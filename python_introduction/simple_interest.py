# Define the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time in years
principal = 1000  # $1000
rate = 0.05       # 5% annual interest rate
time = 3          # 3 years

# Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
